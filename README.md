# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week11: Deep Learning - Part2

We will first complete the CNN example. We will review few major components of DL models, with examples. We will learn how to adapt a pre-trained model to a new problem. Finally we will see an example of a sligthly more complex network architecture.
